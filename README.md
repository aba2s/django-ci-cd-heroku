# django-ci-cd-heroku

As your `Django project` starts growing; the process of testing and
deployment gets cumbersome with time. If we rely heavily upon manual
work, there are high chances that we might forget to follow through a
couple of steps and our application crashes. Itâ€™s always better to
automate redundant work and minimise the chances of application failure
in production. The process followed by the industry to achieve this is
known as `CI/CD`.
